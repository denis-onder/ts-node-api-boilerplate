### About:

This boilerplate has been made to speed up the early stage of the development process, like setting up a basic server and wiring up all the common packages necessary for API/full-stack web application development.

Design pattern wise, this boilerplate had MVC in mind.

It's written to be used with TypeScript and Express. The database solution used here is Postgres, which uses Sequelize as it's layer of communication. This can, however, easily be changed.
